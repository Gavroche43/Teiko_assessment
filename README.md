## Features  
- **Data Analysis Pipeline** for generating relative frequency CSV and boxplots  
  - **Input:** Place `.csv` files into `/raw_data/`  
  - **Output:** Processed CSV and boxplots saved in `/output_data/` (`.csv` and `.png` formats)  
- **Exploratory Analysis Script** for the Mann-Whitney U test  

---

## ðŸ›  Instructions  

### Run with Docker  
Ensure Docker is installed, then execute:  
```sh
docker build -t custom_image .
docker run -v "$($PWD.Path):/app" -w /app custom-image bash run_pipeline.sh
```

### Run on Unix/Linux

Ensure Python 3 is installed along with dependencies from requirements.txt (pandas, matplotlib), then run:
 ```
./run_pipeline.sh
```
### Running the Exploratory Analysis

    Replace the file path for cell_counts
    Open and execute the .ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
    Alternatively, run the .py file

##ðŸ’¬ Comments

    Rows missing values for 'treatment' and 'response' were included in the cell counts CSV
    but removed for boxplots and final data analysis
    Used Mann-Whitney U test instead of t-test due to:
        Small sample size
        Usage of relative rank over absolute count
        No assumption of normality
    The pipeline might be overkill for this assessmentâ€”a simpler script would have sufficed ðŸ˜…
